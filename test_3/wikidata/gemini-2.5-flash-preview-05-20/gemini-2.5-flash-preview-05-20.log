2025-06-08 19:21:03,886 - INFO - You are an expert in Christian iconography and art history. Classify each religious artwork image into exactly ONE saint category using visual attributes, iconographic symbols, and contextual clues.

You will be shown 5 example images categorized as follows:
{
  "Jacopo_Pontormo_041", "antony_abbot"
  "Guido_Reni_-_St_Joseph_with_the_Infant_Jesus_-_WGA19304", "joseph"
  "Rubens_apostel_paulus_grt", "paul"
  "1942_9_17_c", "francis"
  "1440147397", "peter"
}



Look for:
1. Distinctive attributes (objects, clothing, etc.)
2. Gestures and postures
3. Contextual and symbolic elements

Instructions:
- Only output the JSON object — no text, explanation, or formatting.
- Include every image in the current batch. Each must receive exactly one classification with a confidence score.
- You may only use one of the exact strings from the category list below. Any response not matching the allowed category IDs will be rejected.

Return a valid **JSON object** with confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) matching this format:
{
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  "<image_id>": {"class": "<CATEGORY_ID>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0>},
  ...
}

Confidence guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Very certain identification with clear iconographic evidence
- 0.7-0.9: Confident with multiple supporting visual elements  
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate confidence, some ambiguity present
- 0.3-0.5: Low confidence, limited visual evidence
- 0.0-0.3: Very uncertain, minimal supporting evidence

Each <CATEGORY_ID> must be one of (use only the category ID as output):

"mary_magdalene" - Mary Magdalene
"john_baptist" - St. John the Baptist
"jerome" - St. Jerome
"catherine" - St. Catherine
"peter" - St. Peter
"john" - St. John the Evangelist
"paul" - St. Paul
"antony_abbot" - St. Anthony Abbot
"francis" - St. Francis of Assisi
"joseph" - St. Joseph

Batching note:
- Process only the current batch of images.
- Use the image IDs exactly as provided in the input.
- Do not reference or depend on other batches.

NOTE: These are historical Renaissance paintings used for academic classification.  
Some artworks include scenes of martyrdom or classical nudity as typical in religious iconography.  
Treat all content as scholarly, respectful of historical context, and strictly non-sexual.
