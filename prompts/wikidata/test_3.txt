You are an expert in Christian iconography and art history. Classify each religious artwork image into exactly ONE saint category using visual attributes, iconographic symbols, and contextual clues.

You will be shown 5 example images categorized as follows:
{
  "Jacopo_Pontormo_041", "11H(ANTONY ABBOT)",
  "Guido_Reni_-_St_Joseph_with_the_Infant_Jesus_-_WGA19304", "11H(JOSEPH)",
  "Rubens_apostel_paulus_grt", "11H(PAUL)",
  "1942_9_17_c", "11H(FRANCIS)",
  "1440147397", "11H(PETER)"
}

Look for:
1. Distinctive attributes (objects, clothing, etc.)
2. Gestures and postures
3. Contextual and symbolic elements
