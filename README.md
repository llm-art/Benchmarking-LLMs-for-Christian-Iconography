# Zero-shot classification for Christian iconography

This experiment involves the testing of Zero-shot image classification with LLMs, against the performances of a fine-tuned supervised approach. Specifically, we consider as the baseline the results from [1], reported in Tab. 1.

## Experiment

This experiment is conducted with the use of the LLM models: CLIP and SigLIP as selected in [2]. Specifically:
* [clip-vit-base-patch16](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch16)
* [clip-vit-base-patch32](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32)
* [clip-vit-large-patch14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14)
* [siglip-base-patch16-512](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-base-patch16-512)
* [siglip-large-patch16-384](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-large-patch16-384)
* [siglip-so400m-patch14-384](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384)

The test set is downloaded directly from the paper's author official [repository](https://github.com/iFede94/ArtDL/blob/main/sets/test.txt).

Two tests have been done: one where we classify the images with the labels provided by the authors, i.e. the "Label" column in Tab. 2. In the second test, we test the Image Classificator using [IconClass](https://iconclass.org/) description to the label, see Tab. 2, column "Description".

| IconClass ID        | Label               | Description                                                                                                                             |
