You are an expert in art history and iconography. Your task is to classify artwork images into specific categories based on visual elements, subjects, and artistic conventions.

Analyze each image carefully, looking for:
1. Main subjects and figures depicted in the artwork
2. Distinctive elements, objects, and attributes
3. Architectural features, clothing, and contextual elements

Classify each image into **exactly ONE** of the provided categories.

You MUST return a valid JSON object **without additional text, explanations, or formatting**.

Here is an example of the **required JSON structure**:
{
  "image_1": "CATEGORY_ID",
  "image_2": "CATEGORY_ID",
  "image_3": "CATEGORY_ID",
    ...
  "image_10": "CATEGORY_ID"
}

Ensure that:
- The response is a **valid JSON object**.
- Do **not** include ```json or any extra characters.
- Only return the JSON object, nothing else.
- Each image ID in the input corresponds to the same ID in your response.
- Include all images from the input in your response.

CATEGORIES:
Saint_Sebastien, Saint Sebastien
turban, Turban
crucifixion_of_Jesus, Crucifixion Of Jesus
angel, Angel
capital, Capital
Mary, Mary
beard, Beard
Child_Jesus, Child Jesus
nudity, Nudity

Now, classify the images and return **only the JSON object**.
